### Important things to remember

- What changes when state changes

### Redux

#### Why Redux

- it is really good for handling big react application
- Redux is used to share data between components
- state management of redux

  - single source of truth
  - state is read only
  - Changes using pure function

  pure function recieves a input and return a output

  - Action is what how interacts with ui
  - Reducer is a pure function
  - Store is the entire state of the application

- Redux uses FLUX pattern

action -> dispatcher -> store -> view
